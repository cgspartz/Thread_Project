Project2
Written by Christopher Spartz

Project2Spartz.c: This file contains the entirety of my program.
It contains all of the threads, as it initializes them and waits for them to finish.
It contains the semaphores and buffers I needed for my threads to ensure concurrency and no race conditions.
Additionally it implements the reset requested and the reset finished methods from encrypt-module.h
